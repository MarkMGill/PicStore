# PicStore
Fictional store searching and purchasing framed pictures retrieved from Unsplash API created with React.  Basic search functionality from an online course, but I added several features such as React Router to show the home page, search results page, and details page, extra information from the Unsplash API in the details page, some basic styling, and simple navbar and footer.

# Functionality
Search for anything you'd like a picture of, and search results will display.  Click on the one you like, and it will bring up a detailed description of the item, and display the options to buy, add to cart, and how many you'd like to buy.

# Technologies Used
* React
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Responsive Web Design
* AJAX call to Unsplash API
* React router
